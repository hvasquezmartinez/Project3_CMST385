<p>Atmosphere is a hip-hop group based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
The group consists of rapper Slug (Sean Daley) and producer Ant (Anthony). 
Atmosphere has been making history in the underground hip-hop community for over 25 years. 
In 1997, Atmosphere released their debut album, Overcast!, and began touring the states. It wasn't long before Slug categorized his music as "emo rap", a genre used to describe Atmosphere and many others with similar sounds. While Slug is known to be a master at storytelling intriguing narratives, Ant ties it all together by mixing sounds of soul, funk, and reggae into hip-hop's realm. </p>
